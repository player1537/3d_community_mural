==================
3D Community Mural
==================

This project includes the server side component to the 3D Community
Mural project. The 3D aspects come from the use of OSPRay on the
server side, following a Tapestry-like architecture.


How to Run
----------

Currently there is not a web server frontend. However, to get a single
image out, you can follow these steps. For convenience, the steps
have been added to a Makefile, so in simple cases you can just run:

  $ make out.png
  $ python3 -m http.server 8888
  $ # open http://localhost:8888/out.png in the browser

Without the Makefile, you would need to run these commands:

  $ ./go.sh build  # Create the Docker image with OSPRay and Python installed
  $ ./go.sh run /opt/app/server  # Create the out.bin file with raw pixel data
  $ ./go.sh run python3.7 -u foo.py  # Create out.png from out.bin
