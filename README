==================
3D Community Mural
==================

This project includes the server side component to the 3D Community
Mural project. The 3D aspects come from the use of OSPRay on the
server side, following a Tapestry-like architecture.


How to Run
----------

Before you run these commands, you need to have OSPRay downloaded. You
can download it from its Releases page on GitHub [0]. We are using
version 1.8.5.

To run the server, we need to create a Docker image with OSPRay
installed. You can do this by first running:

  $ ./go.sh build

Then to actually run the server:

  $ ./go.sh run python3.7 -u server.py /opt/app/server

Then open http://localhost:8801 and you will see the scene
rendered. You can click and drag on the image that's returned to
rotate around the scene. Zooming does not currently work well.
